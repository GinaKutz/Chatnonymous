AS A user 
I WANT all my messages and data to delete upon closing the site
SO THAT my message data can be kept private

WHEN I enter the site
THEN I am presented with a homepage in which I can enter my login information or make an account
WHEN I click start
THEN I am presented with a list of chatrooms
WHEN I click a chatroom
THEN I am presented with a blank chat
WHEN I send a message
THEN everyone in the chat sees it
WHEN another user sends a message
THEN I see the message with everyone else
WHEN I close the webpage
THEN no data of the chat is stored anywhere
