# Chatnonymous
Welcome to our Project Three! This application is inteneded to facilitate the exchange of messages between different users in temporary chat rooms. This application will feature chat rooms that are set to self destruct after the final user exits the room. The chat is not persistent and is only accessible to the users that are in the room at the time of sending. User name and password will be stored in a database so they can be accessed anywhere.
